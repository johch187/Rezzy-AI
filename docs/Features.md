# Keju Feature Breakdown

This document provides a detailed look at the major features of the Keju application, their purpose, and their technical implementation.

## 1. Profile Management & Builder

-   **Location:** `HomePage.tsx`, `components/ProfileForm.tsx`, `components/Sidebar.tsx`
-   **Purpose:** To create comprehensive sources of truth for the user's professional identities. This profile context is foundational for all AI interactions.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   **Multi-Profile Support:** Users can create, rename, delete, and switch between multiple, distinct profiles from the sidebar.
    -   **Comprehensive Form:** A multi-section accordion form allows users to input everything from personal info and work experience to custom-defined sections for the active profile.
    -   **Resume Import:** Users can upload a `.pdf`, `.txt`, or `.md` file. The `parserService.ts` parses the file and populates the *currently active* profile form.
    -   **Autosave & Manual Save:** The profile is automatically saved to `localStorage` periodically, and a "Save Changes" bar appears for immediate manual saves.

## 2. Document Generation & Analysis Suite

### a. Document Generation
-   **Location:** `GeneratePage.tsx`
-   **Purpose:** To generate resumes and cover letters that are highly tailored to a specific job application, using the currently active profile as the data source.
-   **Workflow:**
    1.  The user provides a job description via URL or paste.
    2.  The user selects which items from their active profile to include.
    3.  `generationService.ts` compiles a detailed prompt and calls the Gemini API to generate the documents.

### b. Generation Results & Editor
-   **Location:** `GenerationResultPage.tsx`, `components/EditableDocument.tsx`
-   **Purpose:** To allow users to review, refine, and export their AI-generated documents.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   **Smart Parsing:** Upon receiving the generated markdown, the app uses `parserService.ts` to parse it back into a structured format for rich editing.
    -   **Rich Editing:** The document is displayed in a form-based editor where users can edit individual fields.
    -   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** For resumes, users can drag and drop entire sections.
    -   **Export Options:** Users can download their final document as a PDF or copy the content to paste into Google Docs.

## 3. AI Career Coach & Career Path

### a. AI Career Coach

-   **Purpose:** To provide an interactive, conversational interface for personalized career advice and to act as a central hub for the app's tools.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   **Contextual Session:** `careerCoachService.ts` initializes a chat session with the Gemini API, providing a detailed system prompt that includes the user's full active profile and history.

        -   Updating the user's profile summary.

    1.  The user requests a career path from the **AI Career Coach**.
    2.  The coach calls the `promptToCreateCareerPath` tool, showing a confirmation UI to the user.
    3.  If the user agrees, `generationService.ts` generates a detailed, 5-year plan.
    4.  The result is saved to the active profile, and the `CareerPathPage` displays it as an interactive, scroll-aware timeline.
