## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Build for production: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`).

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. Create/activate a Python 3.11+ virtualenv.
2. Install deps: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
3. Set environment variables (see `.env.example` for required keys such as Supabase, Gemini, BigQuery, Polar, CORS/CSP).
4. Run locally: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` from the `backend` directory (PYTHONPATH should include `/app/backend` in Docker).

### Docker / Cloud Run
- Multi-stage Dockerfile builds the frontend and serves it via the backend container.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/cloudrun.yml`) builds, pushes to Artifact Registry, and deploys to Cloud Run. Secrets must be provided via GitHub/Cloud Run (do not commit real env files).
